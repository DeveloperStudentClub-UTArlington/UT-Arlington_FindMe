### UT-Arlington_FindMe
**FindMe** is a mobile application that allows you to find "visible" friends, buildings, parking spots and many other infrastructures on-campus! 
* FindMe only works within the limits of the UT Arlington campus
* To find a friend, users would have to add them to their contacts list
* The App users will be able to toggle their visibility every **1hour** to remain visible on the map
* Users can "favorite" places and buildings to permanently display them on the map
* Clicking on a "bubble" will directly trigger a direction path along with the ETA by walk or drive
